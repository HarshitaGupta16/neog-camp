# Basic Tags in HTML

## @typography

hr tag: This tag gives a break (line in between) to differenciate 1st part, 2nd part and so on.

h1 tag: This is the biggest heading
h2 tag: This is the second biggest heading
p tag: Normal Text. Free flowing text that will wrap at the end like a paragraph.
small tag: This is relatively smaller text



With HTML whole typography can be controlled.

## @Container: They have no meaning for specially abled people.
1. Fluid Container: Goes end-to-end on a page.
2. Centered Container: It will go till specified width.

## Links: Defined by anhor tag <a>
Primary Link: a href="/" Primary Link /a [Where we want the user to click everytime]
Secondary Link: a href="/" Secondary Link /a

## Block vs Inline Elements:

e.g: h3, div, p
2. Inline Elements: When we write something and it takes only takes it's own space and not the whole row
e.g: small

## Lists:

  <nav> tag

## Header: Like we have cover image and profile picture
   use img src="" tag 
   (try using public image like on Twitter)

## Section: <section> tag
1. White Section: This will have white background.
